# W1_Attempt to create Grids
## Nested Loop - For
<iframe src="https://editor.p5js.org/GemTran/full/EkDrokbRI" width="100%" height = "242px"></iframe>


I tried to many ways to create the grids based on the given code.
i tried to duplicate the for loop code for the vertical lines but it only ran a single vertical line.
I search many videos on how to make them and one of which was called Nested Loop.
And based on the video, it is said that nested loop can generate codes on both x and y axis of the canvas at the very same time
So I thought it might be suitable for this work. 
I created another for loop inside another for loop. I created a new variable called j for the vertical line loop and replaced it into the height value of the square operation.
However, I couldn't use the original code to initialize this loop so I had to make some changes in the values of the square.
